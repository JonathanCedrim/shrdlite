The: Exactly one
  The: Exactly one -- 1 goal (why not OR?)
  Any: Anyone      -- Or of ors
  All: Everyone    -- Or of And

Any: Anyone        
  The: Exactly one -- Or     (why not or of ors?)
  Any: Anyone      -- Or of ors    
  All: Everyone    -- Or of ands

All: Everyone
  The: Exactly one -- And    (why not and of ors?)
  Any: Anyone      -- And of ors
  All: Everyone    -- And of ands 

Algorithm:

1. Find entities of the first quantifier         CHECK IF != 1 (while THE)
2. Find entities of the second quantifier          "" 
3. Merge them using the rules above

The/Any
  The/Any  -- Or of ors
  All      -- Or of ands

All
  The/Any  -- And of ors
  All      -- And of ands


DETECTING IMPOSSIBLES
- Impossible relationships
- Not enough locations (i.e: put all balls in a box <- less boxes than balls).
- Any/The in all (let it fail in case?)
- All in all? Impossible unless 1 and 1 (let it fail?)
