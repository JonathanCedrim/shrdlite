We started to implement a partial order planner as an advanced planning
algorithm but got stuck at a half-finished state. 

The basic building blocks of this algorithm are move actions with their 
preconditions and effects. A partial order of the actions and causal links 
between effects and preconditions.

A move action specifies a move of an object from one position to another position
by say√≠ng what has to be true before it can execute and what is true after. 
The proconditions and effects are represented as conjuncts of simple predicates such as 
(ball ontoop box), (box1 < box2) etc.
They are variable (those above were insansiated) and can thus mold in to any wanted move 
action that fit the constraints.

The algorithm works by firstly setting up a start state (as an action that precedes
every other action, has no preconditions and has the start state as it's effects)
and a goal state (as an action thet procedes(?) every other action with the
goal as an precondition and nothing as it's effects)
The goal state is then put on the agenda (a queue of precondition conjuncts we want 
to satisfy)

We call the algorithm with this so called null plan
A high-level rough description of the algorithm follows
1)
  Choose a goal on the agenda, if it's empty: we're successfull.
2)
  Try to instanciate or choose an already existing action that has 
  the goal conjunct in it's effects. If we can't, this path was fruitless. Backtrack!
  Order the chosen action before the goal action
  Draw a causal link between the effect satisfying the goal and the goal
  If we instansiated a new action, put all it's precondition conjuncts on the agenda.  
3)
  We now check if any causal link is potentially interfering with any action.
  If we find that an action who's effects negate a causal link is not surely ordered
  before or after that causal link then we must either move the action before or after the 
  causal link. If neither is consistent with our ordering, backtrack.
4)
  Recursively invoke algorithm
  
If the algorithm returns successfully then we have a consistent ordering of move actions
leading from start to goal state.

This above is the proposed algorithm which we intended to implement.
At this moment the algorithm cannot yet fully handle variable actions, physical constraints,
disjunctive preconditions and only the relation ontop is supported (which is were we got stuck.)
