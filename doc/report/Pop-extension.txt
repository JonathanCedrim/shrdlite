We started to implement a partial order planner as an advanced planning
algorithm but got stuck at a half-finished state.

The basic building blocks of this algorithm are move actions with their 
preconditions and effects. A partial order of the actions and causal links 
between an effects and an preconditions.
move actions are partially instansiated -- example, explanation
  physical constraints, transitive special relations etc.
  
It works by firstly setting up a start state (as an action that precedes
every other action, has no preconditions and the start state as it's effects)
and a goal state (as an action thet 'procedes' every other action with the
goal as an precondition and nothing as effects)
The goal state is put on the agenda (a queue of precondition predicates we 
want to satisfy)
  
 
The algorithm then chooses a goal on the agenda (if it's empty, we're done) 
It instansiates an appropriate action (one that has the goal in it's effects)
The chosen action is then ordered before the goal we wanted to achive.
A causal link is drawn between the chosen action's effect and 
the goal
We now check if any action interferes with any causal link.
