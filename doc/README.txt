Actual status of the project:

We have the basic part totally working. We have implemented
in separate modules the planner and the interpreter. We have
a simple A-star algorithm that is working now with heuristic
0 and cost 1 (breadth first search).

Therefore we have implemented a Partial Order Planner but 
right now is in experimental state.

We also have an aproach to handle quantifiers but is also
not finished yet.


List of possible extensions:

For sure:

 - Quantifier handling
 - Partial order planner
 - Disambiguation

Still thinking about:

 - Present suggestions to the user.
 - Some theoretical extension about Natural Semantics.
